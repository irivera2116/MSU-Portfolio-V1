# MSU-Portfolio-V1
Portfolio V1, my first attempt at creating a portfolio website!

## User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
I started with a basic html and started deciding on what to put in. Adding an image of myself from a few months ago and setting up a short about me portion.
Using a reset.css template from the bootcamp, i used a basic reset and created my style.css to reflect my preffered styling. The contact information box was a template used from the website below. 

To see the deployed website please follow this link:
