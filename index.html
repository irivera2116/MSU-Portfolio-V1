        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am excited to be learning how to code! I'm looking to grow into a full-time developer and hopefully get into game designing.
            I spend a good portion of my time on my computer whether it's to code more frequently or to play a few games to decompress after
            a long day.

                <p>This is the first coding project I worked on as I learned about HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                    I used these coding languages to craft a basic website that serves as a cheatsheet to assist
                    me in my journey to understand coding.
