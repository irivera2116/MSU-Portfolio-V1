        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am excited to be learning how to code! I'm looking to grow into a full-time developer and hopefully get into game designing.
            I spend a good portion of my time on my computer whether it's to code more frequently or to play a few games to decompress after
            a long day.
